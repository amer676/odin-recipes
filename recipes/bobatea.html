    <h2>Ready to get a taste of asia with our new boba tea recipe?</h2>
    <p>
        Boba tea, or bubble tea, is a popular drink that originated from Taiwan. I made this coconut variation because I had coconut cream on hand and wanted something different from the regular black milk tea variation. This coconut version tastes 
        just like the one you'll find in a bubble tea cafe.
